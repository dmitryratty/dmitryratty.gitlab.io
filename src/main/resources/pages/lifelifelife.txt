Well, well, well... Life!

The Three Kingdoms period including the collapse of the Han is one of the bloodiest in Chinese history. A nationwide census taken in 280 AD, following the reunification of the Three Kingdoms under the Jin shows a total of 2,459,840 households and 16,163,863 individuals which was only a fraction of the 10,677,960 households, and 56,486,856 individuals reported during the Han era.

I was thinking the Three Kingdoms war numbers must be inflated, so I did some digging. And yeah it checks out... At the end of the Han dynasty (200 AD-ish), China made up around 25% of the world population. That means for 20% of the world population to die, basically 4/5 people in China would have needed to die. In the late Han Dynasty, a census reported a population of around 56 million people. After the Three Kingdoms period, once the Jin dynasty reunified China, another census reported a population of 16 million. That's basically 3/4 people in China dying during this period... Pretty darn close to the insane 4/5 figure. I'm suddenly feeling very lucky that I wasn't a Chinese peasant in 200 AD.

In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His "driving" experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced comas for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were often carried out on patients who entered the institute for common problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanent effects from his actions. His treatments resulted in victims' urinary incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents and thinking their interrogators were their parents. </> During this era, Cameron became known worldwide as the first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association as well as president of both the American Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Psychiatric Association. Cameron was also a member of the Nuremberg medical tribunal in 1946–1947.

Массовое убийство в станице Кущёвской. </> Остальные двинулись в комнату, где сидели женщины и дети. Увидев нас, Аметов стал отбиваться кием. Я повалил его на пол, стал душить и ударил несколько раз ножом. Андрюха и Беспредел в это время убивали Владимира Мироненко.

Остальные ребята шерстили комнаты в доме и расправлялись с гостями. Двух дочек Мироненко — пяти и двух лет, и жену сына Сервера Аметова Лену затолкали в ванную, чтобы криков не услышали соседи.

Фермер мешал мне вести бизнес, подрывал мой авторитет. Поэтому я хотел, чтобы он мучился сам и видел, как мучаются его близкие. Мы выволокли его в зал — он ещё дышал, и на его глазах расправились с остальными. Потом бросили тела в одну кучу, а сверху, на гору трупов, положили девятимесячную Амиру — внучку Аметова. Она живая была, плакала. Тела облили бензином и подожгли. Посмотрели на часы и удивились — провернули всё минут за десять.

Выходя из дома, бандиты заметили убегающего мальчика — 14-летнего Пашу Касьяна. Его мать, соседка Аметовых, была у них в гостях, и подросток решил её поторопить — время было позднее. Быков выстрелил мальчику в спину и отволок в дом. Затем убийцы как ни в чём не бывало отправились в местное кафе «Малинки».

One of these attempts was by his ex-lover Marita Lorenz, whom he met in 1959. She agreed to aid the CIA and attempted to smuggle a jar of cold cream containing poison pills into his room. When Castro learned about her intentions, he reportedly gave her a gun and told her to kill him but her nerves failed. Some plots aimed not at murder but at character assassination; they, for example, involved using thallium salts to destroy Castro's famous beard, or lacing his radio studio with LSD to cause him disorientation during the broadcast and damage his public image. </> When Castro travelled abroad, the CIA cooperated with Cuban exiles for some of the more serious assassination attempts. The last documented attempt on Castro's life was in 2000, and involved placing 90 kg of explosives under a podium in Panama where he would give a talk. Castro's personal security team discovered the explosives before he arrived.

It has been claimed he was involved in the ethnic cleansing of Kasaians from 1960 to 1962 in Katanga and tried to obtain Belgian support. It has been alleged that Munongo was involved in the death of Lumumba in 1961. Before his death Munongo was quoted in a newspaper as saying that he would, if Lumumba came to Katanga, do what the Belgians could not do and kill him. </> Lumumba and two other ministers were beaten on a plane journey to Katanga. Near the airport at Luano in Lubumbashi, they were all tortured, and Lumumba was personally assaulted by Katangan leaders, including Munongo and Belgian officers. After they were shot by a firing squad, their bodies were dissolved in acid. In reports Munongo said, "I will speak frankly, If people accuse us of killing Lumumba, I will reply: 'Prove it'." At the Conference Nationale Souveraine shortly before his death, Mabika Kalanda asked him, "Godefroid, you are one of the survivors who participated in the end of Patrice Émery Lumumba. Why would you not take advantage of the CNS to tell us your truth?" Munongo emotionally replied, "My dear Mabika, you put an important issue before me. What I can say at this stage is that I was not alone. We were numerous. We'll have to get all these people together. But anyway, I can say at that time, we were working, without realizing it, for the interests that were not ours. We were young". </> The family website records that Munongo was going to break his silence on the death of Lumumba, but on the day of the announcement, he suffered a heart attack and died on 28 May 1992.

Aspartame was discovered accidentally by a chemist researching a completely unrelated topic. At some point, he licked his finger to grab a piece of paper and noticed a strong sweet taste.

Cyclamate was discovered by a grad student who put his cigarette on his bench, then smoked it again and noticed the cigarette was sweet. </> I know what you're thinking. The kind of guy who lights up cigarettes in a chemistry lab and places them in the middle of uncharacterised compounds before taking them to his mouth again, must have died young of an interesting death. I checked – he proceeded to live to the old age of 87.

Saccharine was discovered by a researcher who ate bread without washing his hands and noticed the bread was sweet.

Acesulfame K was also discovered serendipitously by a chemist licking his fingers, although the legends don't specify the exact circumstances behind the finger-licking.

Sucralose. While researching novel uses of sucrose and its synthetic derivatives, Phadnis was told to "test" a chlorinated sugar compound. According to an anecdotal account, Phadnis thought Hough asked him to "taste" it, so he did and found the compound to be exceptionally sweet.

It is therefore a fact of the world that virtually all the popular synthetic sweeteners were discovered accidentally by chemists randomly eating their research topic.
