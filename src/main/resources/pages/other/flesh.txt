A characteristic of autism is having special interests or passions and cognitive rigidity. The interests may involve collecting objects or information, but some interests could be interpreted as indicating schizophrenia. We knew an autistic adult who had an intense interest in medieval church law and, due to his reading of obscure religious texts, made the logical decision that the current Pope was illegitimate. He was determined to travel to the Vatican to denounce the Pope based on the evidence he had carefully analysed and collated. There were no accompanying signs of schizophrenia, but he was admitted to a secure psychiatric hospital and discharged when he discovered a replacement interest in computer games. </> A psychiatrist may ask a question such as, ‘Do you hear voices?' to which Wen Lawson, who is autistic, replied, ‘Yes' – the correct answer based on a literal interpretation of the question (Lawson, 1998). He heard voices of people talking around him every day. His answer contributed to the psychiatrist's opinion that he had schizophrenia.
