Iterated prisoner's dilemma. Tit for tat with forgiveness. Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Monte Carlo method. Win–stay, lose–switch. Relatives self-sacrificing min-maxing.

A tit-for-tat population is penetrable by non-retaliating nice strategies, which in turn are easy prey for the nasty strategies. Noise presence, revenge cycles - forgiveness.

Kaczynski was an awkward but gifted student, in a school IQ test he’d scored 167. </> In a lab not far from where Skinner had once experimented with pigeons, psychologists linked to US intelligence were now experimenting with humans — one of whom was Kaczynski. Under the glare of blinding lights, he was methodically humiliated to see how he reacted. He claimed the experience didn’t affect him, and yet, within just a few years, he’d developed an intense paranoia about psychological conditioning.

Of what value is adding a few years to your life if the cost is a life worth living?

...

Casinos keep their customers happily losing money by distracting them with minor side games they’re likely to win. The small victories convince them they’re winning overall even as they lose the only games that actually matter.

This strange quirk of human behavior can even cost lives. In South Korea, a young couple became so addicted to raising a virtual baby that they let their real baby starve to death. The parents prioritized what they could quantify — levelling up their virtual baby — over that which they couldn’t — the life of their real one.
