    <p>Aspartame was discovered accidentally by a chemist researching a completely unrelated topic. At some point, he licked his finger to grab a piece of paper and noticed a strong sweet taste.</p>

    <p>Cyclamate was discovered by a grad student who put his cigarette on his bench, then smoked it again and noticed the cigarette was sweet. &lt;‚Ä¢&gt; I know what you're thinking. The kind of guy who lights up cigarettes in a chemistry lab and places them in the middle of uncharacterised compounds before taking them to his mouth again, must have died young of an interesting death. I checked ‚Äì he proceeded to live to the old age of 87.</p>

    <p>Saccharine was discovered by a researcher who ate bread without washing his hands and noticed the bread was sweet.</p>

    <p>Acesulfame K was also discovered serendipitously by a chemist licking his fingers, although the legends don't specify the exact circumstances behind the <span class="nowrap">finger-licking.</span></p>

    <p>Sucralose. While researching novel uses of sucrose and its synthetic derivatives, Phadnis was told to "test" a chlorinated sugar compound. According to an anecdotal account, Phadnis thought Hough asked him to "taste" it, so he did and found the compound to be exceptionally sweet.</p>

    <p>It is therefore a fact of the world that virtually all the popular synthetic sweeteners were discovered accidentally by chemists randomly eating their research topic.</p>
